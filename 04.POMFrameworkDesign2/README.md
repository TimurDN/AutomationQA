## Project Highlights

1. **Java OOP Principles:**
   - This project is meticulously designed and implemented using Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Emphasizing concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, the codebase is structured to enhance modularity, maintainability, and overall software design.

2. **JUnit 5 Testing Framework:**
   - Leveraging the power of JUnit 5, the project ensures robust and effective testing. JUnit 5 provides a comprehensive testing framework with features like parameterized tests, improved extension model, and enhanced support for dynamic tests, contributing to reliable and efficient test suites.

3. **Page Object Model (POM) Implementation:**
   - Following the Page Object Model (POM) pattern, each page in the application has its own dedicated class. This promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular and readable.

   - **Locators, Pages, and Assertions:**
     - Each page class encapsulates locators for the elements on that page, ensuring a centralized and easily maintainable repository for identifying UI elements.

     - Assertions specific to each page are also contained within the respective page classes. This approach enhances code organization and readability.

   - **Getter Methods for Locators:**
     - To facilitate better code maintainability, getter methods are implemented for each locator. This not only abstracts away the intricacies of locating elements but also ensures that changes to UI elements are localized to the corresponding page class, minimizing the impact on the overall codebase.

These highlights underscore the commitment to Java OOP principles, the effectiveness of JUnit 5 for testing, and the structured implementation of the Page Object Model for improved code organization and maintainability.
